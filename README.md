## Overview
The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon’s army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille’s development of his Braille tactile writing system. While this project's scope is much smaller, it is capable of translating a text message from English to Braille by reading the characters in the `message.txt` file and writing the English word into the `braille.txt` file. This program also translates the same `braille.txt` file and writes to an `original_message.txt` file through the command line interface.
